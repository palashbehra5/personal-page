            <div class="blog-intro">
                As we returned from our respective internships in the third semester of our MTech programs, we approached what was arguably the most intense and stressful phase, placement preparation. Ideally, one would have started early, but the demanding curriculum had left little room for dedicated prep. The challenge, then, was clear: how could we achieve the best results with minimal yet strategic preparation?
            </div>

            <img src="images/intro.png" alt="LeetCode NetworkX Visualization" class="feature-image">
            
            <p>
                Given the many companies hiring for SDE roles, most naturally focus on practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. This preparation typically falls into two approaches:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Patiently solving problems from a standard textbook, our choice being Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos (as covered in our Advanced DSA course), while carefully developing, if not formal, at least intuitive proofs for solutions.</li>
                <li>Memorizing solutions to frequently asked interview problems, relying on pattern recognition rather than deep understanding.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Most of us, however, land somewhere in between, attempting to cover a diverse set of commonly asked problems with enough variation to maximize exposure to different problem patterns. For that, we rely on sheets curated by professionals.
            </p>

            <p>
                A bottleneck emerges while covering diverse topics: the Paradox of Choice. With an ever-growing influx of problem sheets, we often waste time deciding where to start. This also introduces a Developer Bias, as these sheets are typically curated by individuals whose selection criteria may not align with our specific needs or weaknesses.
            </p>

            <p>
                This raised fundamental questions about effective problem progression in such a broad domain. Is there a universally ideal starting problem for each topic? What sequence of problems maximizes conceptual understanding? More importantly, can we move beyond individual intuition and develop data-driven procedures that offer generalizable learning strategies?
            </p>

            <h2>Modelling</h2>
            <p>
                If we assume that problems are related, a graph is a natural choice to represent these relationships. The edges must be directed since progression is a key requirement, indicating the flow from simpler to more complex problems. Additionally, edges should only exist between similar problems to ensure meaningful transitions, and weights can be assigned based on relative difficulty to guide an optimal learning path.
            </p>

            <h2>Feature Selection</h2>
            <p>
                To establish meaningful connections between problems, we need strong features that effectively convey similarity. When visiting a problem page, we are presented with multiple attributes:
            </p>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <img src="images/feature_selection_description.png" alt="Problem Description Feature" class="feature-image">
                <p class="image-caption">
                    The problem description might not be accurate, as it often presents an abstraction rather than the core concept. Additionally, it relies heavily on informal and natural language, which may fail to convey meaningful insight into the problem's underlying structure.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <img src="images/feature_selection_topics.png" alt="Problem Topics Feature" class="feature-image">
                <p class="image-caption">
                    A good representation but not very exhaustive. The assigned topics do not always cover the multiple approaches a problem can be solved with. This is important because exploring different approaches provides an opportunity to learn new techniques or think outside the box.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <img src="images/feature_selection_comments.png" alt="Problem Comments Feature" class="feature-image">
                <p class="image-caption">
                    Pretty self-explanatory.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="image-caption">
                    Not bad, but not great either. Code alone is not a strong feature since syntax does not inherently convey much about the problem, and the structure of a solution can vary significantly based on individual coding styles. The combination of a solution and its description is also unreliable, as poorly written explanations often introduce noise with unnecessary details or provide no explanation at all.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-section">

                <p class="image-caption">
                    This is the safest bet so far, as it provides a frequency-wise distribution of topics based on submissions from many users. Since these tags emerge from collective user input, they offer a more generalized and statistically significant representation of problem-solving approaches.
                </p>

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                With the dataset in place, the exploration began.
                Due to the large size of the full correlation heatmap, it isn't practical to visualize in its entirety.
                Instead, the tags have been grouped into clusters, where each cluster brings together tags with stronger mutual correlations.
                A simple linear correlation analysis yielded the following clustered results:
            </p>

                A heatmap of the Pearson correlation between user-submitted solution tags provides insights into how different problem-solving approaches relate to each other. Higher correlation values indicate that certain techniques frequently appear together, suggesting possible conceptual overlaps or dependencies between problem types.

                Analyzing the top correlating solution tags reveals expected relationships:

            <h3>Strongest relationships between algorithm tags</h3>
            <p>
                These correlations align with intuitive expectations. DFS and BFS commonly appear together due to their fundamental tree and graph traversal roles. The strong association between recursion and trees further supports its prevalence in pre- and post-order traversal problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since our feature vectors become sparse due to the high number of unique tags, we can employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain denser embeddings while reducing redundancy. This allows for more compact and meaningful representations of problem relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that the feature vectors were available, the next step was determining an appropriate threshold for identifying neighboring nodes. One approach was to set a similarity threshold, considering an edge between two nodes only if their cosine similarity exceeded a certain value. Such a graph was defined at various thresholds, and its structural statistics were analyzed at each level.
            </p>

                <p class="image-caption">The analysis was initially performed at thresholds of 25, 50, 75, and 90, before being narrowed down to a more refined range. The goal was to determine a threshold that minimized the number of connected components, ensuring that all problems remained reachable from each other. Outlier detection was conducted based on the total number of submitted tags to address the issue of small-sized clusters, but it did not yield any significant improvements.</p>
            </div>

                <p class="image-caption">Clustering was employed as an approach for topic modeling, where the maximum voted tags within a cluster could assist in unsupervised classification of a set of problems. However, this approach introduced a challenge.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Clustering solely using K-Means resulted in a large, dense cluster where many problems were grouped together, while others were confined to much smaller clusters. This imbalance indicated that K-Means struggled to properly capture the structural relationships between problems.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Addressing this problem at an algorithmic level required devising a heuristic solution to manage small cluster sizes. The pseudocode was implemented to enforce a constraint on the maximum cluster size, ensuring no cluster exceeded a predefined limit.

                The cluster sizes improved after enforcing the maximum size constraint, but the issue of small clusters still persisted. To address this, a merging routine would be required, potentially introducing an additional constraint to ensure better cluster balancing. This aspect remains an open challenge and will be explored as part of future work.

                Now, the graph between nodes i and j is defined using the NetworkX library, a Python package designed for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of complex networks. Edges are established between nodes where the cosine similarity of their respective feature vectors exceeds 0.7. Additionally, a directed edge is assigned based on the absolute difference in problem ratings, ensuring that the direction reflects the relative difficulty between problems.

                <p class="image-caption">Designing a custom algorithm that favors the lowest edge weights leads to smoother transitions but produces a very long path â€” around 257 problems in this case. The interactive tool above allows you to fine-tune the path by adjusting top_k (to control variation) and max_entries (to limit the number of problems).</p>
